# `#`100daysofcode Challenge 2019

After following this hashtag for quite a while, I've decided to start my own one. I am currently trying to update my existent web knowledge to the tech stack of 2019. At work I focus on my companys web stack, therefore this challenge might be a great approach to get up to date in my spare time.

At the moment I am collecting different tasks for this challenge and plan on starting it end of july/ beginning of august.

## Current ToDos:
* JavaScript30 Challenge by Wes Bos
* Read the You-dont-know-JS Books
* Advanced React.js course
